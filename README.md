# Lenker

Lenker is an open-source VPN ecosystem for providers and users.

This repository currently contains the initial monorepo skeleton for `MVP v0.1`. The scope is intentionally narrow and follows the documents in [docs/MVP_SPEC.md](/Users/vaceslavibraev/Desktop/vpn_service/docs/MVP_SPEC.md), [docs/architecture.md](/Users/vaceslavibraev/Desktop/vpn_service/docs/architecture.md), [docs/database.md](/Users/vaceslavibraev/Desktop/vpn_service/docs/database.md), [docs/api.md](/Users/vaceslavibraev/Desktop/vpn_service/docs/api.md), and [docs/roadmap.md](/Users/vaceslavibraev/Desktop/vpn_service/docs/roadmap.md).

## MVP v0.1 Scope

Included:

- provider panel
- node agent
- users, plans, subscriptions, devices
- REST API v1
- PostgreSQL-based data model
- client app for Android, Windows, and macOS
- single production protocol path: `VLESS + Reality + XTLS Vision`

Excluded from this repository stage and from `MVP v0.1`:

- marketplace
- billing
- Telegram bot as a core module
- multi-protocol production support beyond the main path
- white-label provider builds

## Directory Guide

- `services/panel-api` — Go service for the provider control plane
- `services/node-agent` — Go service for managed node lifecycle
- `apps/panel-web` — React + TypeScript provider UI
- `apps/client-app` — Flutter client app for Android, Windows, and macOS
- `migrations` — database migration files for PostgreSQL
- `docs/adr` — architecture decision records

## Conservative Decisions

- The panel backend and node agent are separate Go modules.
- The web panel is prepared as a standalone React + TypeScript app.
- The client app is prepared as a standalone Flutter app shell.
- No repository area is created for marketplace or billing because they are out of scope for `MVP v0.1`.

## Status

This repository now includes the first `panel-api` backend foundation. It prepares the service entrypoint, config loading, HTTP routing, health checks, structured logging, graceful shutdown, PostgreSQL storage bootstrap, basic repository interfaces, minimal admin login foundation, and initial PostgreSQL migrations.

It does not include production business logic, billing, marketplace features, or VPN/Xray runtime logic yet.

## Backend Foundation

Run the panel API from its module:

```sh
cd services/panel-api
go run ./cmd/panel-api
```

The service exposes:

- `GET /healthz`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/login`
- `GET /api/v1/users`
- `GET /api/v1/plans`
- `GET /api/v1/subscriptions`

`GET /healthz` is functional. `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/login` uses the initial admin auth service and session skeleton. The list routes are wired to initial PostgreSQL repositories, require the first migration to be applied, and require an admin session token in `Authorization: Bearer <session_token>`.

Conservative auth note:

The current password verifier accepts `sha256$<hex>` or `sha256:<hex>` hashes as a foundation-only implementation. Before real provider use, replace this with a stronger password hashing policy such as bcrypt or Argon2id and migrate stored admin hashes accordingly.
